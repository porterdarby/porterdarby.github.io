title: Ender 3 v2 with a Magnetic Bed
tags: 3dprinting

I tried using a magnetic bed, specifically the [Creality Original Ultra-Flexible Removable Magnetic 3D Printer Build Surface Heated Bed Cover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNWSMXY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).

Installation was pretty easy -- just install the magnetizable surface to the bed using the sticky size. Put the magnetic on it. Adjust as needed to reach the desired height.

I found a couple of issues:

1. **Adhesion wasn't great.** This could be a lack of an actual adhesive applied to the bed, or just the bed not being close enough. If there is a little bit of warping, then we might be running into that.

Actually, it was just that. The adhesion of the bed wasn't good at all, and it made it difficult to really test it. I wonder if I were to apply the sticky side of the bed to a build plate and use that as the base if it would help? If I've screwed up the hot plate, then that sucks. Thankfully, the glass plate seems to fix itself and is quite thick that it doesn't really have any warp.

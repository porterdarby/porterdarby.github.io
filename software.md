Here's some cool software I've found over the years that I've used for various reasons:

# Programming Languages
## Java
* [MVNRepository](https://mvnrepository.com/)
* [GrepCode](http://grepcode.com)

## ECMAScript/Javascript
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Because I like statically typed languages.

## Python
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv): I find this particularly helpful when making sure I have the right environment set up for Python. I can easily install multiple versions, set up the right virtualenvs, all that fun stuff, without really having to worry about it in particular.
* [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/): Because I like statically types languages.
